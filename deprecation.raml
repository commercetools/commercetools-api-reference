headers:
  X-DEPRECATION-NOTICE:
    description: |
      As the SPHERE.IO platform evolves, some features are superseded by better implementations and should not be used
      anymore. The goal of our deprecation process is to communicate at runtime with users if they happen to use such
      deprecated feature. To achieve this in a non breaking fashion SPHERE.IO uses an additionnal custom HTTP header
      called "X-DEPRECATION-NOTICE" with a specific message relative to the deprecation.
