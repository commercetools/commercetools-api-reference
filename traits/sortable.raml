#%RAML 1.0 Trait

queryParameters:
  sort:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: |
        A query endpoint that supports sorting does so through the sort query parameter. The provided value must be
        a valid sort expression. The default sort direction is ASC. The allowed sort paths are typically listed on
        the specific query endpoints.

        Here are some examples of sort expressions:

            name desc
            dog.age asc

        If multiple sort expressions are specified via multiple sort parameters, they are combined into a composed
        sort where the results are first sorted by the first expression, followed by equal values being sorted
        according to the second expression, and so on.

        Note: The sorting is case sensitive.
    example: <<sortExample>>
