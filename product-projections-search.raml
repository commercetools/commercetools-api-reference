displayName: Product Projection Search
description: |
  This endpoint provides high performance search queries over ProductProjections. The query result contains the
  ProductProjections for which at least one ProductVariant matches the search query. This means that variants can
  be included in the result also for which the search query does not match. To determine which ProductVariants match
  the search query, the returned ProductProjections include the additional field isMatchingVariant.
