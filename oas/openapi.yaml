            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with
              exponential backoff up to a point where further delay is unacceptable.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`

              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Internal Server Error

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

        The query endpoint allows to retrieve custom objects in a specific container or all custom objects.
        For performance reasons, it is highly advisable to query only for custom objects in a container by using
        the container field in the where predicate.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `503`:

            * `OverCapacity`
              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with
              exponential backoff up to a point where further delay is unacceptable.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:

                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay

            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Service Unavailable

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `503`:

            * `OverCapacity`
              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with
              exponential backoff up to a point where further delay is unacceptable.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.

              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or

            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

                The invalid value.

              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).

              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with
              exponential backoff up to a point where further delay is unacceptable.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String

              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with
              exponential backoff up to a point where further delay is unacceptable.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with
              exponential backoff up to a point where further delay is unacceptable.

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application

                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `503`:

            * `OverCapacity`
              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `503`:

            * `OverCapacity`
              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with

              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:

                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `503`:

            * `OverCapacity`
              The service is having trouble handling the load. The client application should retry the request with

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or

              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay
              is unaceptable. If these errors persist, [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to

            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.

              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or

              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String

                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has

              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

              A required field is missing a value.

              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.

            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            ## Internal Server Error

            A 500 indicates that a request failed due to a server-side problem that needs to be resolved before subsequent
            requests can succeed. It either indicates a temporary unavailability or permanent server-side problem that needs
            to be reported and resolved.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `500`:

            * `General`
              A server-side problem occurred that is not further specified.
              These errors [should be reported](http://support.commercetools.com/).

            * `PendingOperation`
              A previous conflicting operation is still pending and needs to finish before the request can succeed.
              The client application should retry the request with exponential backoff up to a point where further delay

            ## Conflict

            A 409 indicates that the resource targeted by the request (with the intention to modify or delete the resource),
            was modified since the last time the client has requested it. As a reaction, the client will usually want to
            request the newest version of the resource to see what has changed and may then decide to apply the same or other
            changes to the new version, or discard his changes entirely.

            Conflicts indicate a concurrent modification and usually occur on versioned resources, for which the client has
            to include the version of the resource whenever he intends to apply modifications to it.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `409`:

            * `ConcurrentModification`
              The request conflicts with the current state of the involved resource(s).
              Typically, the request attempts to modify a resource that is out of date,
              i.e. that has been modified by another client since the last time it was retrieved.
              The client application should resolve the conflict (with or without involving the end-user)
              before retrying the request.

            ## Bad Request

            A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
            Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
            a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
            in the response before re-sending the request.

            The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

            * `InvalidInput`
              Invalid input has been sent to the service.
              The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
              before sending the request.

            * `InvalidOperation`
              The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application
              should validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.

            * `InvalidField`
              A field has an invalid value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `invalidValue` - *
                The invalid value.
              * `allowedValues` - Array of * - Optional
                A fixed set of allowed values for the field, if any.

            * `RequiredField`
              A required field is missing a value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.

            * `DuplicateField`
              A value for a field conflicts with an existing duplicate value.
              Extra fields:
              * `field` - String
                The name of the field.
              * `duplicateValue` - *
                The offending duplicate value.
