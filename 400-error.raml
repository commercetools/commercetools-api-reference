  ## Bad Request

  A 400 is the most commonly expected error response and indicates that a request failed due to providing bad input.
  Bad input can be a malformed request body, missing required parameters, wrongly typed or malformed parameters or
  a parameter that references another resource that does not exist. Clients need to resolve the problems mentioned
  in the response before re-sending the request.

  The following general error codes can appear in responses with the HTTP status code `400`:

  * `InvalidInput`

    The client application should validate the input according to the constraints described in the error message
    before sending the request.

  * `InvalidOperation`
    The resource(s) involved in the request are not in a valid state for the operation. The client application should
    validate the constraints described in the error message before sending the request.
