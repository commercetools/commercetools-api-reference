Commercetools Platform API reference documentation

### Overview
This repository contains the representation of commercetools APIs. This repository includes the
officially released features of the API (GA and Open Beta).

Based on the RAML definition we generate our SDKs, the Postman collection and the OpenAPI definitions.

### How to use it

The `api-specs` folder includes the different APIs provided by commercetools in RAML format. The `api-specs/graphql`
contains the GraphQL schema in SDL.

The `oas` folder includes generated OpenAPI schemas based on the RAML files.

The `uml` folder contains a representation of the APIs in PlantUML and a rendering of files as SVG.

### Postman
