  An abstract sellable good with a set of Attributes defined by a Product Type.
  Products themselves are not sellable. Instead, they act as a parent structure for Product Variants.
  Each Product must have at least one Product Variant, which is called the Master Variant.
  A single Product representation contains the _current_ and the _staged_ representation of its product data.
