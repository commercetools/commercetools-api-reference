    format: int64

      It is the number of elements skipped, not a page number.

  count:

      The actual number of results returned.
  total?:
    type: number
    format: int64
    description: |
      The total number of results matching the query.
      This number is an estimation that is not [strongly consistent](/general-concepts#strong-consistency).
      This field is returned by default.
      For improved performance, calculating this field can be deactivated by using the query parameter `withTotal=false`.
      When the results are filtered with a [Query Predicate](/predicates/query), `total` is subject to a [limit](/contract#queries).
  results:
    type: CustomerGroup[]
    description: |
      The array of [CustomerGroups](ctp:api:type:CustomerGroup) matching the query.
