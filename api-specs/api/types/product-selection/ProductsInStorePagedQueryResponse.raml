    description: |
      Total number of results matching the query.
      This number is an estimation that is not [strongly consistent](/general-concepts#strong-consistency).
      Unlike other endpoints, the Product Selection endpoint does not return this field by default.
      To get `total`, pass the query parameter `withTotal` set to `true`.
      When the results are filtered with a [Query Predicate](/predicates/query), `total` is subject to a [limit](/limits#queries).
  results:
    type: ProductSelectionAssignment[]
    description: ProductSelectionAssignments matching the query.
