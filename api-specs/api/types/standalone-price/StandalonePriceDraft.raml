type: object
description: |-
  Standalone Prices are defined with a scope consisting of `currency` and optionally `country`, `customerGroup`, and `channel` and/or a validity period (`validFrom` and/or `validTo`). For more information see [price selection](/../api/projects/products#price-selection).
  Creating a Standalone Price is rejected if there already exists a Standalone Price for the same SKU with exactly the same price scope, or with overlapping validity periods within the same price scope. A Price without validity period does not conflict with a Price defined for a time period.
