      - list of States of the same `type` that the current State can be transitioned to. For example, when the current State is the _Initial_ State of [StateType](ctp:api:type:StateTypeEnum) `OrderState` and this list contains the reference to the _Shipped_ `OrderState`, the transition _Initial_ -> _Shipped_ is allowed.
      - if empty, no transitions are allowed from the current State, defining the current State as final for this workflow.
      - if not set, the validation is turned off and the current State can be transitioned to any other State of the same `type` as the current State.
