  This action updates the `shippingAddress` on the Order, but it does not change the shipping address on the referenced [Cart](ctp:api:type:Cart) from which the Order is created.
  Also, it does not recalculate the Cart as taxes may not fit to the shipping address anymore.

  Produces the [Order Shipping Address Set](ctp:api:type:OrderShippingAddressSetMessage) Message.
