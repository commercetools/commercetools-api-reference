displayName: LineItemPriceMode
type: string
description: |
  This mode indicates how the price is set for the Line Item.
enum:
  - Platform
  - ExternalPrice
  - ExternalTotal
(enumDescriptions):
  Platform: |
    The price is [selected](/../api/pricing-and-discounts-overview#line-item-price-selection) from the Product Variant.
    This is the default mode.
  ExternalPrice: |
    The Line Item price is set externally.
    Cart Discounts can apply to Line Items with this price mode.
    All update actions that change the quantity of a Line Item with this price mode require the `externalPrice` field to be given.
  ExternalTotal: |
    The Line Item price with the total is set externally.
    Cart Discounts are deactivated for Line Items with this price mode, despite a matching [CartDiscountLineItemsTarget](ctp:api:type:CartDiscountLineItemsTarget) or [MultiBuyLineItemsTarget](ctp:api:type:MultiBuyLineItemsTarget).
    Although a Line Item with this price mode has both `price` and `totalPrice` set externally, only `totalPrice` is used to calculate the total price of a Cart.
    All update actions that change the quantity of a Line Item with this price mode can set the new price with the `externalTotal` field.
    If the `externalTotal` field is not given in the update actions, the external price is unset and the price mode is set to `Platform`.
