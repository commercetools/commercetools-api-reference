    description: |
      Indicates how the discount applies when using [CartDiscountPatternTarget](ctp:api:type:CartDiscountPatternTarget).

      - If the mode is `IndividualApplication`, the discounted percentage is applied on each unit's price. The units matching the `triggerPattern` are not considered.
      - If the mode is `ProportionateDistribution` and `EvenDistribution` the discounted value is calculated from the total value of the units matching the `targetPattern` and distributed among the units matching the `targetPattern` or `triggerPattern`. These modes are allowed only if [CartDiscountPatternTarget](ctp:api:type:CartDiscountPatternTarget) `triggerPattern` is non-empty.
