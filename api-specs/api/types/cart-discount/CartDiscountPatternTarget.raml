  Pattern targets can be used to model Buy and Get discounts.

  Unlike [CartDiscountLineItemsTarget](#cartdiscountlineitemstarget) and [CartDiscountCustomLineItemsTarget](#cartdiscountcustomlineitemstarget), it does not apply to a (Custom) Line Item as a whole, but to individual units of a (Custom) Line Item. The discounts can apply multiple times on the same cart, but each unit can be discounted only once.
properties:
  triggerPattern:
    type: array
    items: PatternComponent
    description: |
      Defines the set of units of (Custom) Line Items in a Cart that trigger a discount application.

      Based on the availability of matching units, the `triggerPattern` can match multiple times, limiting the number of maximum times the discount will be applied.
      To further limit the discount application, set the `maxOccurrence`.

      If empty, the Discount will apply indefinitely.
  targetPattern:
    type: array
    items: PatternComponent
    description: |
      Defines the set of units of (Custom) Line Items in a Cart on which the Discount is applied.

      This array cannot be empty.
