displayName: CountOnLineItemUnits
discriminatorValue: CountOnLineItemUnits
properties:
  predicate:
    type: string
    description: |
      Valid [LineItem predicate](/../api/projects/predicates#lineitem-field-identifiers) that determines the units participating in the Discount.
  minCount?:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Minimum number of units of a Line Item that match the predicate.
    minimum: 0
    default: 1
  maxCount?:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Maximum number of units of a Line Item that match the predicate.
      There might be more units matching the predicate, but they will not be participating to the resulting set.

      The value must be greater than or equal to `minCount`.
      If not provided, the component will match all units that satisfy the predicate.
    minimum: 1
  excludeCount?:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Number of units of a Line Item to exclude on every application of the Discount.

      Set only when configuring the `targetPattern`.

      The units matched first (satisfying the pattern component) will be excluded from the resulting set.
      The `minCount`and `maxCount` are considered only after the exclusion. Pattern components are matched only if any further units satisfying the pattern component exist.
      For example, if 5 jeans are required but only 3 should be discounted, the `excludeCount` value must be 2.
    default: 0
