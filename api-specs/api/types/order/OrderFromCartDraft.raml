      String that uniquely identifies an order.
      It can be used to create more human-readable (in contrast to ID) identifier for the order.
      It should be unique across a project.
      Once it's set it cannot be changed.
      For easier use on Get, Update and Delete actions we suggest assigning order numbers that match the regular expression `[a-z0-9_\-]{2,36}`.

      [Custom Fields](/../api/projects/custom-fields) for the Order. The Custom Field type must match the type of the Custom Fields in the referenced [Cart](/../api/projects/carts#cart).
      If specified, the Custom Fields are merged with the Custom Fields on the referenced [Cart](/../api/projects/carts#cart) and added to the Order.
      If empty, the Custom Fields on the referenced [Cart](/../api/projects/carts#cart) are added to the Order automatically.
