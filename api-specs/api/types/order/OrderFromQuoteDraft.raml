  orderNumber?:
    type: string
    description: |-
      String that uniquely identifies an order.
      It can be used to create more human-readable (in contrast to ID) identifier for the order.
      It should be unique across a project.
      Once it's set it cannot be changed.
      For easier use on Get, Update and Delete actions we suggest assigning order numbers that match the regular expression `[a-z0-9_\-]{2,36}`.
