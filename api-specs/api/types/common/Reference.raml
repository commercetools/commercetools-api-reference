description: |
  A Reference represents a loose reference to another resource in the same Project identified by its `id`. The `typeId` indicates the type of the referenced resource. Each resource type has its corresponding Reference type, like [ChannelReference](ctp:api:type:ChannelReference).  A referenced resource can be embedded through [Reference Expansion](/general-concepts#reference-expansion). The expanded reference is the value of an additional `obj` field then.
example: !include ../../examples/Common/Reference.json
