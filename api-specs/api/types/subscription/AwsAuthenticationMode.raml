  Credentials: |
    Subscriptions with `Credentials` authentication mode are authenticated using an `accessKey` and `accessSecret` pair. This is the default authentication mode for backwards compatibility.
  IAM: |
    Subscriptions with `IAM` authentication mode are authenticated using Identity and Access Management (IAM). For this authentication mode, the following user requires permissions to send notifications to the queue or publish to the topic: `arn:aws:iam::362576667341:user/subscriptions`. This is the recommended authentication mode, as it doesn't require additional key management.
