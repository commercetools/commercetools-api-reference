    type: number

  total?:
    type: number

    description: |
      Total number of results matching the query.
      This number is an estimation that is not [strongly consistent](/../api/general-concepts#strong-consistency).
      This field is returned by default.
      For improved performance, calculating this field can be deactivated by using the query parameter `withTotal=false`.
      When the results are filtered with a [Query Predicate](/../api/predicates/query), `total` is subject to a [limit](/../api/limits#queries).
  results:
    type: Extension[]
    description: |
      Extensions matching the query.
