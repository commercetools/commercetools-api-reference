  [PagedQueryResult](/../api/general-concepts#pagedqueryresult) with `results` containing an array of [Types](ctp:api:type:Type).
properties:
  limit:
    type: number
    format: int64
    description: |
      Number of results requested in the query request.
  offset:
    type: number
    format: int64
    description: |
      Offset supplied by the client or server default. It is the number of elements skipped, not a page number.
  count:
    type: number
    format: int64
    description: |
      Actual number of results returned.
  total?:
    type: number
    format: int64
    description: |
      Total number of results matching the query.
      This number is an estimation that is not [strongly consistent](/../api/general-concepts#strong-consistency).
      This field is returned by default.
      For improved performance, calculating this field can be deactivated by using the query parameter `withTotal=false`.
      When the results are filtered with a [Query Predicate](ctp:api:type:QueryPredicate), `total` is subject to a [limit](/../api/limits#queries).
  results:
    type: Type[]
    description: |
      [Types](ctp:api:type:Type) matching the query.
