        The My Business Unit endpoint does not support assigning existing Customers to a Business Unit.
        Use this endpoint to create a new Customer and associate it with the Business Unit.
        The user must have the `Admin` role within the Business Unit to perform this request.
        The new Customer is created with an empty set of roles.
