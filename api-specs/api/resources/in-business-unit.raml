        The My Business Unit endpoint does not support assigning existing Customers to a Business Unit.
        Associates with the `UpdateAssociates` [Permission](ctp:api:type:Permission) can use this endpoint to create a new Customer and associate it with the Business Unit.
        If the required [Permission](/projects/associate-roles#permission) is missing, an [AssociateMissingPermission](/errors#associatemissingpermission) error is returned.
        The new Associate is created with an empty set of roles.
