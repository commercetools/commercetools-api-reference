usage: Generator annotation types.

annotationTypes:
  enumDescriptions:
    description: |
      Describes the values of an enum type.
    type: object
    properties:
      //:
        description: |
          Adds a description for the enum value given by the key.
  enumGroups:
    description: |
      Groups the values of an enum type.
    type: object
    properties:
      //:
        description: |
          Specifies the group for the enum value given by the key.
  beta:
    description: |
      if true, designates that the element is not released yet like regular elements and should be treated as being subject to
      changes, incompleteness and ongoing development.
      Documentation must provide a hint that the element is in beta status and can opt to hide such elements.
      If not set, false must be assumed.
    type: boolean
  deprecated:
    description: |
      If true, designates that the element carrying this annotation should not be used any more and is subject to potential later removal.
      If used, the description text should explain the new way the effect of the deprecated element is to be achieved.
      If not set, false must be assumed.
      Documentation can choose to hide deprecated elements, mark them deprecated or make them less prominent as needed.
      Documentation must not suppress the fact that an element is deprecated.
    type: boolean
  refersTo:
    description: |
      Must contain either a type name in the current API or a detectable addressing scheme like URN or URL pointing to other entities.
      if the `refersTo` annotation is used on a RAML element it designates that the element is referring, linking or pointing to another type of entity.
      Documentation should generate a navigatable link to that other entity.
