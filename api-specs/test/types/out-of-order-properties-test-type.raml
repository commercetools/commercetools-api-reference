      Tests out of order properties. By convention, `id`, `key`, `version`, `createdAt`,
      `createdBy`, `lastModifiedAt` and `lastModifiedBy` should display at the top (in that order).
      `custom` should display at the bottom. All other properties should render in the order they
      appear.
      Some types will not have all of the 'conventional' properties – i.e. cart doesn't have a key field.
      In this case, ordering would go `id`, `version`... etc.
